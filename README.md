## Get a new profession for free
I've put together a list of resources I believe are enough to become a junior full-stack developer in 10-12 months. This is just the beginning of the journey of course, but by getting to the end of the list one could take control of their further progress depending on their own personal interest and ambition.

## Courses
**Stage1**
[CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) - Simply the best intro course to computer science. By the end of the 12 weeks you will know if coding is for you or not.
[Beyond CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/beyond/2019/) - Good extension of the original course to get more in-depth knowledge
[Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - Teaches the basics of front-end development through bite sized tasks
[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) - Super practical and hands on intro to different areas of front-end. All the intro courses are free.
[Git and Github crash course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-crash-course/)

**Stage2**
[Javascript30](https://wesbos.com/javascript30) - Learn JS through 30 daily challenges
[CS50 Web Programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)


**Stage3**
[Full stack cloud developer course by IBM](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer) - it is a paid for course but can be audited for free (no task gradings then)
[CS50's intro to AI](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python) - CS50 intro is a prerequisite

## Content
**Books**
[Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a free and comprehensive book to learn JS

**Twitter**
I suggest to follow (beyond the course channels):
- [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode)
- [CodeNewbie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CodeNewbie)

## Tools
**Git/github**
Set-up an account early and start building a portfolio of study projects. Many of the courses will require a github account anyway.
The other great benefit is being able to collaborate with fellow students from an early stage. I highly recommend this, because it simulates the real-world work environment.

**Stackoverflow**
As you start building more complex projects web search won't necessarily will get an answer for you. SO is a great community of developers, who appreciate smart questions. Be present early, so you can start building your reputation score. I also suggest browsing questions. Giving answers to fellow students will help you to think about certain topics more deeply.
